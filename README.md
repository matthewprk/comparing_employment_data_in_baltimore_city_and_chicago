# Comparing Employment Rates in Baltimore and Chicago Based on Parent Income (Opportunity Atlas)

## Background Information
For this project, I chose to analyze Baltimore City, MD and Chicago, IL (hometown). 
The explored metric is employment rates (%) based on parent income (high, medium, and low). This is interesting to me, because I wanted to know if parent income can have an effect on employment rates. This ties into discussions about social mobility, as employment is important for moving up the socioeconomic ladder. The findings could also explain what causes differences in employment rates for either city. I also had a preconception that both cities suffer from economic disparities (wealth gap). This analysis would help quantify that assumption. 

## Business Question
How does parent income contribute to employment rates in Baltimore and Chicago and what are the key differences between the two cities?
