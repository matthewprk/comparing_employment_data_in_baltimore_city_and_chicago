# Comparing Employment Rates in Baltimore and Chicago Based on Parent Income (Opportunity Atlas)

## Background Information
For this project, I chose to analyze Baltimore City, MD and Chicago, IL (hometown). 
The explored metric is employment rates (%) based on parent income (high, medium, and low). This is interesting to me, because I wanted to know if parent income can have an effect on employment rates. This ties into discussions about social mobility, as employment is important for moving up the socioeconomic ladder. The findings could also explain what causes differences in employment rates for either city. I also had a preconception that both cities suffer from economic disparities (wealth gap). This analysis would help quantify that assumption. 

## Business Question
How does parent income contribute to employment rates in Baltimore and Chicago and what are the key differences between the two cities?

## Data Sources
[Baltimore City Employment Data](https://github.com/matthewprk/comparing_employment_data_in_baltimore_city_and_chicago/blob/master/Chicago%20Employment%20Data.xls0) - This dataset shows employment data for Baltimore City based on parent income. 

[Chicago Employment Data](https://github.com/matthewprk/comparing_employment_data_in_baltimore_city_and_chicago/blob/master/Baltimore%20City%20Employment%20Data.xls) - This dataset shows employment data for Chicago based on parent income.

[Opportunity Atlas](https://www.opportunityatlas.org/) - This is the website from which tract datasets on employment rates and parent income were originally pulled from.

## Data Analysis and Metrics
### Metric Explored: Employment Rates - This is the % of people employed divided by the labor force. 
- 1 The average employment rate in Baltimore is 71.48%. 
- 2 The average employment rate in Chicago is 74.41%. 
- 3 In Baltimore, employment for people with high-income parents is 78.00%, middle-income parents is 74.51%, and low-income parents is 69.06%.
- 4 In Chicago, employment for people with high-income parents is 76.98%, middle-income parents is 76.40%, and low-income parents is 71.74%.

This shows the difference in employment rates for Baltimore and Chicago, segmented by parent income. Here, we see that Baltimore's employment rate for people with low-income parents is ~2% lower than Chicago's and could be driving a lower overall employment rate.
